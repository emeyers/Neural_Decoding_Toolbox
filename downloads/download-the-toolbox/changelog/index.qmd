<h2>1.0.2 (Tue, Jul 9 2013)</h2>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>basic_DS.m: fixed a bug that would cause an error to occur when shuffling the labels from simultaneously recorded data.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Enhancements</h3>
<ul>

<li>plot_standard_results_object.m: the constructor so can now take a <tt>[num_results_to_plot x num_time_bins]</tt> matrix that has all the decoding results precomputed rather than just a cell array with the names of standard results files. The field <tt>plot_obj.errorbar_file_names</tt> can now also be a <tt>[num_results_to_plot x num_time_bins]</tt> matrix of precomputed errorbars.</li>

<br>

<li>plot_standard_results_TCT_object.m: the constructor can now take a <tt>[num_training_times x num_test_times]</tt> matrix with precompiled decoding results and this object will display a TCT plot with these precompiled results. </li>
